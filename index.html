				<h3>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</h3>
				<p>What other game will be in this list. Super Smash Bros. Ulitmate is the first ever game that I have competed in esports. Overall experience was very solid, the main goal of the game is mainly about strategy and avoid getting KO'd off the screen. </p>
                <p>I believe that this game will become one of the top esport games in the near future.</p>

				<h3>Call of Duty</h3>
				<p>Call of Duty has many game variation, thus the reason why I'm including this game on my list. This game features many ways to play such as mulitplayer, zombies, and camping. The common mode for this game is mulitplayer for the intense competition that is put in the game.</p>

				<h3>Clash of Clans</h3>
				<p>This game may have gotten rusty over the years but it is still very heavily focused on strategy and smart decision making. 5 players per esports team is the common figure in the game, strategy is very important in this game. This game has offered a lot of tournaments and has paid the winning teams thousands.</p>
